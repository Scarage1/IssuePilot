## 📋 Summary

This issue reports a hydration mismatch error occurring when using dynamic imports with SSR in Next.js. Users are seeing console warnings about server/client HTML mismatches. The issue appears when components render differently between server and client due to browser-specific APIs being called during SSR.

---

## 🔬 Root Cause Analysis

The likely root cause is that a component is using browser-specific APIs (like `window` or `localStorage`) during server-side rendering, causing the server HTML to differ from the client-rendered HTML. This creates a hydration mismatch because React expects the initial client render to match the server output exactly.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Steps

1. **Identify the component causing the mismatch** by checking the console warnings for specific component names

2. **Wrap browser-specific code in useEffect() hook** which only runs on the client

3. **Add typeof window !== 'undefined' checks** before accessing browser APIs

4. **Use Next.js dynamic imports with { ssr: false } option** for client-only components

5. **Test with SSR disabled temporarily** to confirm the component is the source of the issue

6. **Consider using the 'use client' directive** for components that require browser APIs
