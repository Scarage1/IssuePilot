  "summary": "This issue reports a hydration mismatch error occurring when using dynamic imports with SSR in Next.js. Users are seeing console warnings about server/client HTML mismatches. The issue appears when components render differently between server and client due to browser-specific APIs being called during SSR.",
  "root_cause": "The likely root cause is that a component is using browser-specific APIs (like `window` or `localStorage`) during server-side rendering, causing the server HTML to differ from the client-rendered HTML. This creates a hydration mismatch because React expects the initial client render to match the server output exactly.",
  "solution_steps": [
    "Identify the component causing the mismatch by checking the console warnings for specific component names",
    "Wrap browser-specific code in useEffect() hook which only runs on the client",
    "Add typeof window !== 'undefined' checks before accessing browser APIs",
    "Use Next.js dynamic imports with { ssr: false } option for client-only components",
    "Test with SSR disabled temporarily to confirm the component is the source of the issue",
    "Consider using the 'use client' directive for components that require browser APIs"
  ],
  "checklist": [
    "Read and understand the Next.js hydration error documentation",
    "Set up a local Next.js development environment",
    "Reproduce the issue with a minimal example",
    "Identify all browser-specific API usage in the affected components",
    "Implement proper client-side checks using useEffect or dynamic imports",
    "Test the fix with SSR enabled and disabled",
    "Verify no hydration warnings remain in the console",
    "Add a test case to prevent regression",
    "Submit PR with detailed description of the fix"
